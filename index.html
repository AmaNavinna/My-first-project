    <ul>
        <li>Hangman is an old school favorite, a word game where the goal is simply to find the missing word or words.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>You will be presented with a number of blank spaces representing the missing letters you need to find.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Use the keyboard to guess a letter (I recommend starting with vowels).</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>If your chosen letter exists in the answer, then all places in the answer where that letter appears will be
            revealed.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>After you've revealed several letters, you may be able to guess what the answer is and fill in the remaining
            letters.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Be warned, every time you guess a letter wrong you lose a life, and the hangman begins to appear, piece by
            piece.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Solve the puzzle before the hangman dies.</li>
    </ul>
