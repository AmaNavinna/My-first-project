# Let's play Hangman!!

Following is a Python script of the classic game “Hangman”. A row of dashes represents the word to guess. If the player guesses a letter in the word, the script writes it in all its correct positions.  The player has 6 turns to guess the word. You can easily customize the game by changing the variables.
